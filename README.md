This is the robot that was used for our class competition. The rules of the game are as follows:

Each opponent starts at opposite ends of the arena, with the green balls in the center.
There is a timer, and within this time period of 2 minutes, the objective is to have as many balls in the robot's starting area as possible.
Robots can grab and steal balls, and shoot lasers at the opponent to slow them down.
The robot with the most balls in their starting area at the end wins.

The C# scripts that were written are in the following path:
